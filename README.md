I’ve got Phd Science focused on numerical and experimental study in acoustics.  It helped me to develop and improve such skills as theoretical modeling, signal processing, programming, experimental measurements. 
I’ve got education as Applied Mathematician for my Master’s degree theory&programming oriented, in particular statistics, optimization methods, machine learning, teaching internship. I developed codes using Matlab&Fortran&Comsol during my PhD. I proposed the project and got in the competition HC Ørsted fellowship. The patent on the results have been sold to the Acousort company. Currently I’m postdoc at DTU Compute performing image analysis and data analytics for improvement of biotechnological processes using Python.
I don’t fear the risk, obstacles or changes because I don’t give up and enjoy improving myself every day. 

I enjoy working in a team as well as to perform an individual task/research. 
I have been working for almost 10 years in engineering environment and I like it lot!
